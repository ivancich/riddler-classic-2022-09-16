This code helps to solve the FiveThirtyEight class puzzle given on
September 16, 2022.

See:
    https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-build-the-biggest-anigram/

It involves anigrams, which is a playful variation of anagrams. In the
standard game you start off with a 4-letter word that you have to
identify from re-arranged letters. And then a new letter is added for
each round until you end up with a 9-letter word.

The number of final letters can be provided as a command-line
argument, otherwise the default of 9 will be used.
